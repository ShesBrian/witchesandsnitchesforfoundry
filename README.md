# witchesandsnitchesforfoundry

## Foundry Module Folder Name
The module folder must be named exactly `witchesandsnitchesforfoundry` to match the `id` in `module.json`. Foundry will not load the module if the folder name and manifest `id` do not match.

## Compendium Organization
These packs ship with folders. Open the Willpower Caster folder in the casting styles pack to find the class and its related features. Open each House folder in the houses pack to find the house item and its related features.

## Using Houses
Open the Witches & Snitches Houses compendium, open your House folder, then drag the House item onto your character. Use the standard dnd5e advancement UI to make any choices; the module does not display any popups.
